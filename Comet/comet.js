/* 
1. 	The planet is centered at the origin
2. 	The planet is rotating (So some surface detail is needed)
3. 	A moon is orbiting around the planet
4. 	The comet movement on its trajectory (use a line, ignoring
	the finer physics of orbits and gravity) is animated as it 
	approaches and impacts the planet.
5. 	Some graphic depiction of the impact is presented (for 
	example a sphere that
	diminishes to zero radius or a particle system explosion. 
	This feature must rotate with the planet.)
6.	Use Particle system methods for comet tail (pointing away 
	from the sun)
7.	Include lighting where the light comes from the sun
